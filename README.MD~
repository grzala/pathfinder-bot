A set of python scripts for that can navigate a robot (globally) and visit a set of predefined points. The robot is capable of finding a path between points using the A* algorithm. It utilises AMCL to reduce the odometry error.

Usage:
Install ros and ros map server
install amcl `sudo apt-get install ros-<ros-distro-name>-amcl`

cd into pathfinder-bot and run `catkin-make`
add the location of /assessment1 and to ros package path:
`export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=path/to/assessment1:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`

Initialize map and params using "roslaunch assessment1 r.launch" and then use "rosrun assessment1 navigate.py"to make robot visit points.

To assess the accuracy of the robot, the robot is dropping markers in Rviz, that are helpful for determining if it sticks to the calculated path, etc.

To change the coordinates of points to visit, edit the assessment1/r.launch file. If stating position of the robot is edited, the file must also be edited. The same file is also responsible for loading the map and starting the map server.
